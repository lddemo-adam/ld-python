        <h1>Demonstration App for LaunchDarkly</h1>
        <p>This demonstration app queries the public Parks On The Air API for "spots" showing amateur radio 
            operators currently advertising a park operation, and displays them based on the selected mode. </p>
        <p>You can filter by mode (e.g. SSB, CW, FT8) and/or by the listed entities (leading string match).</p>
        <h2>About POTA Spots</h2>
        <p>Parks on the Air (POTA) is a popular amateur radio program that encourages operators to "activate" state and national parks,
promoting outdoor operation and public awareness of amateur radio.</p>
        <p>Given the broad activity in the program, there should be some spots at most times of the day, 
            especially US daytime and evening.</p>
        <p>If no spots are shown, consider removing any mode or location filter</p>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>Request "http://.../spots/" to retrieve an unfiltered list of all current POTA spots.</p>
        <p>Optionally:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Filter by Modes</dt>
            <dd>Use .../mode/FT8,CW to filter by mode. Multiple modes can be specified.</dd>
            <dt>Filter by Locations</dt>
            <dd>Use .../locs/US-CA,US-MA to filter by location. Multiple locations can be specified.</dd>
            <dt>Combined Filters</dt>
            <dd>Use .../mode/SSB/locs/US-,CA- to filter by both mode and location.</dd>
            <dt>User Name</dt>
            <dd>To specify a user name, add a request parameter like "...?user=<em>UserName</em>".  This works with or without filters in the path.</dd>
