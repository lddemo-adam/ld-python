This probably won't get maintained for long.

NOTES / PREREQUISITES
I assume system/local installation of recent Python 3, pip, and virtualenv tooling available.  At time of development Python 3.13.4 was used.  The app requires internet connectivity to a public website (pota.app).  

SETUP
* Clone the project from GitHub: <link>
* In the project directory, create a virtual environment using IDE or e.g. "python -m venv ./.venv" (adjust to your python path as needed).  
* Activate the venv with e.g. "source .venv/bin/activate". 
* Install Flask with e.g. "python -m pip install flask" which should result in something like: "Successfully installed blinker-1.9.0 click-8.2.1 flask-3.1.1 itsdangerous-2.2.0 jinja2-3.1.6 markupsafe-3.0.2 werkzeug-3.1.3".
* Install the Requests module with e.g. "python -m pip install requests" which should results in something like: "Successfully installed certifi-2025.4.26 charset_normalizer-3.4.2 idna-3.10 requests-2.32.4 urllib3-2.4.0"
Note: Varying packages for dependencies may be installed depending on your local environment.

EXECUTION
Run the application with:
    % cd python-ld-demo
    % python -m flask run 
    // optionally with IP/port specified: --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5000

CLEANUP 
Exit the venv with "deactivate" command.
